## XKCD Substitutions: Make Reading The News More Fun!

### Usage:
This script needs to be passed to mitmdump, for example:

```mitmdump -s xkcd_sub.py -p 8080```

You'll then need to redirect browsers to this http proxy port. If you want other people to enjoy the same experience, why not try arp spoorfing, rogue DHCP serving, or wpad :)
